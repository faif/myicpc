I'm always looking for interesting ways of improving my coding and problem solving skills. That's why I've decided to start 
solving the ACM-ICPC problems in Python and other pragmatic programming languages. "Why in pragmatic languages?" You might 
wonder. Well, because I believe in languages that increase my productivity and their performance is sufficient in most cases.
